# burger

A full stack app for the UNCC Coding Bootcamp. Using Express to build the server and a MySQL database to store burger information, the app will allow users to add new burgers to the menu and then update the status in the database. All HTML is rendered through handlebars templating.

The app is deployed on Heroku at: https://cam-eats-burgers.herokuapp.com/
